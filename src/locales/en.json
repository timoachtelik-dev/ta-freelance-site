      "content1": "From a young age, I was fascinated by computers, a passion that led me to pursue a technical bachelor's degree in computer science. It was there I had my first contact with development, and I enjoyed it from the very beginning. This passion has been the driving force through my entire career, from my first internship to my current role as a freelance developer.",
      "content2": "My journey is defined by a commitment to learning and growth. I quickly progressed from a Junior to a Senior Developer, a testament to my ability to master new technologies and deliver results. I bring a well-developed, modern skill set combined with a strong sense of responsibility and a commitment to quality for every project I undertake.",
      "applicationContent1": "In my work, good software rarely comes from individual standout features. It comes from clear structures, clean interfaces, and decisions that hold up over time. I focus on systems that remain understandable for teams joining months later.",
      "applicationContent2": "I enjoy working on complex systems, but not complicated ones. When architectural decisions are needed, I aim for solutions that keep room to move instead of creating new dependencies. For me, quality means maintainability under real-world conditions.",
      "applicationContent3": "For about a year I have used Vibe Coding to structure thinking, compare options, and make decisions traceable. I look for a role where I can contribute beyond implementation — technically, structurally, and in collaboration with other engineers."
